## Technologies used
I used Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS. Additional modules include method-override and maybe express-session...? I'm not sure if that actually does anything but I'm scared to remove it at this point.

## MVP
Display records on the index page that a user inputs in the new page.

Index, show, new, edit pages all working and linked with one another, as well as using a CSS framework. 

## The Approach
I had a general idea for creating a database of albums and songs so I could create a random playlist, which would have been fun, but I couldn't make the logic work in the way I had imagined it. I ended up pivoting to just a storefront where someone can post records as if they were for sale, or even just catalogue their records for keeping track of what they have and what they paid for them. I was unable to get sessions/login work properly for it so I ended up just having to roll back to a more simple MVP

## Unsolved problems
I can't get sessions or login to work. I spent the whole week struggling just to break it and then restart, and when I'd have something work properly I would think I was on the right track, but then it would break again. I would have liked to have users and the ability to comment on records or even submit an offer orr something, but I guess that just wasn't in the cards.

## Notes to the developer. From the developer.
Come back and get the login and comments working. Hopefully an admin page/view as well. That'd be pretty neat, might be a good idea to just list all of your records and make TENS of dollars.
